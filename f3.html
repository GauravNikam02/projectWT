<h1>Information of sunflower</h1>
<p>Sunflowers have the ability to grow over 3m tall, with their flower heads growing up to 40cm in diameter. The black central disc of the sunflower is a pseudanthium, or composite flower, and is made up of many small flowers, called florets, to create the single flower-like structure.</p>

<p>The pseudanthium of the sunflower is particularly significant, as it has been used to produce a mathematical model relating to the golden ratio.</p>

<p>The UK produces up to 3,000 tonnes of sunflower seed each year, and is a popular component of bird food products. Sunflowers are one of the most important oil crops in the world, with one ounce of sunflower seed containing around six grams of protein and 14 grams of unsaturated and monounsaturated oils. When cold pressed and unrefined, sunflower oil is high in linoleic acid and vitamin E.</p>

<p>Sunflowers can be grown in a variety of soils although they prefer soil that is well drained, and this annual plant enjoys full sun. When sown in mid- April, they flower in August onwards,  and their seeds can be collected in Autumn.</p>

<p>Each of the 15 flowers in the shortlist were chosen with help from the horticultural team at the Royal Horticultural Society, for their environmental significance as well as their cultural and economic contributions.</p>
